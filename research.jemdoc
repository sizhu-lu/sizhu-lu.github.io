== Research Interest

My research centers on causal inference and its intersection with semiparametric statistics and clinical trials. A unifying theme of my work is the development of methods to identify and efficiently estimate causal effects in complex, real-world settings. I focus on three main directions: 
- causal inference under interference, including bipartite and network experiments; 
- semiparametric efficiency theory for challenging causal parameters, such as principal stratification with continuous post-treatment variables and two-phase designs for local average treatment effects; 
- methodological innovations for clinical trials, addressing issues like competing intercurrent events in randomized controlled trials and information borrowing from nonconcurrent control groups in platform trials. 

Beyond these areas, I also study longitudinal causal inference, machine learning methods for treatment effect heterogeneity, and flexible approaches to sensitivity analysis. Through these projects, my goal is to advance both statistical theory and practice by developing tools that are rigorous, efficient, and widely applicable across the social sciences, public health, and business.
